## What is the Ingress Controller?

The Ingress Controller is an application that runs in a cluster and configures an HTTP load balancer according to Ingress resources. The load balancer can be a software load balancer running in the cluster or a hardware or cloud load balancer running externally. Different load balancers require different Ingress Controller implementations.

In the case of NGINX, the Ingress Controller is deployed in a pod along with the load balancer.
